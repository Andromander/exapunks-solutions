# Andromander's Solutions
This repository contains full solutions to main campaign levels. These solutions were from casual gameplay (and maybe a bit of competitive gameplay), so these solutions are optimised to how I see fit. Solutions here may be updated if improved, however the optimised score may change, so Cycle might be sacrificed in favour of Size or Activity.
Hacker Battles will not be included. Your solution will vary depending on how you handle the AI and your friends.
Post-game levels will not have any solutions. These levels I'm going to leave to you to figure out yourself.
