# Unknown Network 2 - Unknown Context

## The Aim
Grab all the files in the centre host and terminate all other EXAs in the network.

## Synopsis
The best kind of bruteforcing, again. The goal is simple, aas well as the solution considering how late-game this level is. Don't let that fool you, though, as the game will make it as hard as it can by the end.

## Tips and Tricks
The number of enemy EXA remains the same, but the number of files to retrieve will be different, and you have to guess what number each file will be. Luckily, it is noted that all file numbers range from 200 to 299, so there's less of a guessing game here and more iterating values.

The 14 enemy EXAs need to all be terminated via KILL, but beware of the two that are near links, because it could make or break a solution. If you KILL the ones near the links first, not only will you be unable to link through, but the next move will trigger an enemy EXA's KILL, so you either need to leave the host ASAP, or KILL it first. This is more of an issue at the start of the level, but is best done towards the end when it comes to those EXAs.

Once you KILL all the EXAs in the middle host, you can then retrieve all the files they may have been holding. You'll need to iterate between 200 and 299, but this will be your indicator for when you should stop the iterating and start the KILL process on the rest of the enemy EXA.
