# Trash World News - Unknown Context

## The Aim
Rewrite a message in File 212 and move File 200 to the Outbox.

## Synopsis
It's like the first level, but this time there are two more Hosts that weren't there. Not only do you want to complete this level like it was the first, but you also have to complete another task here while you are at it: rewriting someone else's message that could reveal incriminating information.

## Tips and Tricks
As much as starting out with multiple EXAs is annoying, having one do some dirty work while the other is doing the other work can cut down on Cycles. The amount cut down varies, but it all depends on how much work was cut out. Sometimes it is more efficient to start with another EXA.

To move File 200 to the Outbox, copy the solution you had for the first level, and done.

Now for the message. This message is stored in File 212, no problem. Nexe step is the longest part: finding the keywords to replace, then replacing them. In all levels, you have 5 keywords to replace, so you can either have a counter for the amount of times to loop through, or keep it short and make a loop for the End of File, and make sure the other EXA knows to stop.
