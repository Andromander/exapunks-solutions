## The Aim
Get the required data from File 200 and create a new file to have in your Host.

## Synopsis
With such a simple goal, how hard can it be? Well, this is where you will learn how to bruteforce, because the location of the File changes, and it's in a branching network.

## Tips and Tricks
When I say "File 200" I mean one of the three File 200 that exist in this level. They are placed in each different host and each one contains different information. However, in each run, the location of the required data will change, so one moment it's in one host, but next it is in another host. Next, the data shuffles each run, but they still maintain a similar location in the file.

The File in your host contains two keys: one that tells you which host the data is in, the other is the name of the entry you are after. Once you've found the File, then you need to get the required chunk of data, with the information located after the keyword. The location of the data chunk is the first value, while the size of the chunk is the second number.

Once you have completed this level, you will unlock ???????.
