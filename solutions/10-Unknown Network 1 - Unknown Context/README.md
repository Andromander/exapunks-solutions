# Unknown Network 1 - Unknown Context

## The Aim
Get File 276 and bring it to your host.

## Synopsis
With such a simple goal, how hard can it be? Well, this is where you will learn how to bruteforce, because the location of the File changes, and it's in a branching network.

## Tips and Tricks
Somehow you will need to check every host that the File could be in, so you will either need to create a single EXA to traverse all the connections, or send in an army.

Each link is binary, so it will always be 800 or 801, and each host branches off into two others until the end of the tree. Once you reach the end of the branches, you need to get File 276, but it's held by another EXA, and you can't just grab the File from the EXA. You have to KILL it, and then grab the file and bring it back.

Overally, this level is stratightforward, but it does teach you how to be tricky with your code.
