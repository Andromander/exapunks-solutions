# Alliance Power And Light - Streetsmarts GIS Database

## The Aim
Shut down the power in two of the specified hosts.

## Synopsis
Ready for some passive bruteforcing? This level has another navigation panel, but realistically you only need to deal with North, East, and South navigation. There's not much else to say about this level.

## Tips and Tricks
In file 300, there are two keywords. These keywords are the names of the hosts you need to shutdown. Unfortunately, there is no way to tell where in the host they are, so you'll have to do a sweep of the whole place. When you have found the host, write 0 to #POWR and the host will go offline. Note that this means it can be no longer linked to, and any other EXAs in there will die, so plan accordingly.

Host names will shuffle each level and so will the targets in file 300 for each run.

## Bonus
The goal is to only shutdown two of the hosts. Who has time to check if the host is the correct name? Just shut them all down. Doing this will net you an achievement.
