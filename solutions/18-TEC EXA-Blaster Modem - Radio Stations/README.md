# TEC EXA-Blaster Moden - Radio Stations

## The Aim
Replace all the songs in each File with the one in File 300.

## Synopsis
Here's where you are now introduced to dialling to Hosts. Usually, the required dial number usually in a phone number format, but once you start inputting numbers you will see how many single numbers you need. When successful, you will open a Link to one host. Note that you cannot unlock more than one host and EXAs cannot communicate globally if there are no Links

## Tips and Tricks
There is a file in your Host that contains the list of phone numbers. This file is formatted so that each line contains the exact file number. When you input the whole number, the Link in is 800, and the link out is -1. To input a new number, you have to clear #DIAL before you can enter another number. Once the register is cleared, the current Link will disappear. EXAs can no longer communicate to those outside the current Host it is in, and those outside of that Host cannot communicate to those disconnected.

Replacing the songs is easy. For each song name and song title, you replace it with the required song from File 300. Note that the number of songs in the Files must be consistent, so if there are 5 entries, you replace those 5, no more or less.
