# Xtreme League Baseball - Player Database

## The Aim
Using a series of mathematical equations, find the statistically best player and send that name to your host.

## Synopsis
Hope you know how to do maths, and then translate into EXA format. This level will require some calculating of numbers to find the best player of the game. You are given an equation to calculate the stats, so all you need to do is calculate and get the name of the player.

## Tips and Tricks
You are given an equation to calculate the stats of each plauer, but this won't exactly translate well to EXA. What you will need to is the following:
- ADDI BA and ZA
- ADDI the last total and APB
- DIVI the last total by 3
- MULI WRT and OI
- DIVI the last total by OD
- ADDI the last total by the other total
- SUBI PC by PS
- MULI the last total by 20
- ADDI the last total by the other total
If you still get lost, the solutions contain the method.

You'll need to keep a tab not only on the files checked, but the highest stat of the checked files. I recommend having another profiling EXA to do that task. Note that the players in the PENALTY host are invalid players, so you don't need to check them.

## Bonus
What if you just ignored the goal and play a little baseball? If you LINK through 799, you'll end up in the baseball arena, note that you cannot LINK out of it. Complete the whole circuit to get an achievement.
