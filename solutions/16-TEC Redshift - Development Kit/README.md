# TEC Redshift - Development Kit

## The Aim
Get the passcode and the RDK ID.

## Synopsis
This level now throws you a locked Host. You cannot enter these unless you meet the requirement, which in this case is getting the correct passcode. However, there is nowhere that has the passcode to get into the locked Host, so this will require some brute-forcing again.

## Tips and Tricks
To start off, you cannot see the files inthe locked Host until it becomes unlocked, so you will have to start the level finding the passcode first. Note that the required File will always be 199.

There are numerous ways to find out the passcode, but it is recommended that you use SWIZ at some point in the level. The first issue of the zine tells you how to use SWIZ, but to put it simply, there is a way to input a single number when you SWIZ a 3-digit number. This can be used to SWIZ the passcode in and into the new File.

Once you have completed this level, you unlock the Redshift Homebrew, which allows you to create your own Redshift game with EXAs.

## Bonus
There are three other Files that you don't need to touch: two of them are core dumps, and one is a save file. This save file has an entry called "RITE OF PASSAGE COMPLETE" that is set to FALSE, so what happens when it is set to TRUE?
