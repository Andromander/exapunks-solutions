# Digital Library Project - Patron Access System

## The Aim
Copy the information from each required book and bring it to your Host.

## Synopsis
You might notice that some of these links don't have a ID field. This is where you are introduced to navigating on a directional key, usually found on the outside of the network. Next that you notice is that the values you are given in File 300 are not File numbers, rather the location and part of the File ID.

## Tips and Tricks
To start, Linking requires using the key if there is no Link ID display. Unlike blank IDs, no ID fields use a key. In this case, going forward is 800, and backwards is -1. In later levels the link IDs might become a bit more complicated, especially when you are introduced to a large grid.

Next, the files you need; the level explains to you how to get the Files. The values are 3-digit numbers, the first digit from the left is the location in the network, and the next two are the part of the File ID. For example, 512 would be 5 Hosts into the grid, and the required file would be 212.

Note that the number of Files required for each level changes, and the required Files also changes. As a tip, don't list down each LINK command for when the EXA is done copying. Instead, make a loop that continues to LINK until it crashes into the end.
