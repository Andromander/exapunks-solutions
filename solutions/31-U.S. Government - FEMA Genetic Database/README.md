# U.S. Government - FEMA Genetic Database

## The Aim
Find the genetic sequence of one politician with the genetic sequence of another.

## Synopsis
Advanced anti-Government tactics. The goal is to take the genetic data from 'PRES WALKER CAINE' and replace 'SEN WALKER CAINE JR' with this sequence. Sounds easy enough, but it is a little more complicated than that.

## Tips and Tricks
You start with file 300, containing the names of the politicians you are going to target. In order to get the sequence for each one, you'll need to go into DRIVE-1 host and get file 200. Search by name and then collect all the numbers under that name.

To navigate to the correct file, you'll need to get a number from the sequence you got. The first digit from the left is the Drive number, so if it is 5, you need to go into DRIVE-5. The second number from the left is the file number, so if it is 4, the file you need is 204. Finally, the third number from the left is which row you need to get the values from, so if it is 3, it is the third row.

Once you are in the correct drive with the correct file and in the correct row, either copy it so it can be pasted, or overwrite it with the new sequence. Repeat this for all the numbers in the sequences obtained.
